# Solvehelp-Website
This website was initally done for Solvehelp, a startup by my friend, Kiki Odazie and me. After the idea was discontinued, we decided it would be safe to put this website as an open-source project for others to contribute to. Feel free to contribute to this project.Right now, it's basically for practice. We'll use it to test out new ideas and features.;)
